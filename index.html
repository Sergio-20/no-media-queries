        <p>
          The game's storyline focuses on a young man named Wander who enters a forbidden land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi,[4] in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi.[5][6] Shadow of the Colossus has been described as a puzzle game, as each colossus can only be killed by attacking...

          Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is the third major platform game installment in the Rayman series.
